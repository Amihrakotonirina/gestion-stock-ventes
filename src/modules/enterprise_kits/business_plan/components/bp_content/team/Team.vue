Personnel Plan: Plan de personnel
Our plan is for the owners to hold unsalaried positions until January 2001. At that point, they will each receive a salary of $28,000 per year, increasing to $40,800 per year in 2002. These figures are reflected in the following table as well as in the Profit and Loss table.

Management Team:

XYXY will be directly responsible for administration and sales. XXXX will be responsible for clerical and bookkeeping.

As soon as a positive cash flow of $3,000 per month is achieved, 2 commissioned salespeople will be hired as independent contractors. Our plan is to recruit these 2 salespeople in major metropolitan areas outside of Virginia.

Management Team Gaps:

The owner has been working in an environment in which decisions about marketing and advertising sources were made by upper management.Â ZZZZ will be our source for marketing materials, brochures, and advertising materials. They offer a comprehensive support system for their licensees in all aspects of day-to-day business, and we will rely heavily on this support system.
